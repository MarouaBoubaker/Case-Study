# MusicAlbums

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run with proxy:  ng serve --proxy-config=proxy.conf.json

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
For the sorting task I implemented two versions:
1. Drag and drop the cards, and you will see the transitions.
2. Hit The button and make a sorting according to the release date.

To show Details view: Please click on the Card to navigate to details view.

For unit Test I added some basics test for The Api for example.
